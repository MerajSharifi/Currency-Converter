# Currency Converter

I built a currency calculator with Javascript.

I used this API: https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD

Technical specifications:

- Requesting the API and storing the Exchange rates as well as a list of currencies for the dropdowns.
- User can enter an amount
- User can choose a currency to convert from(default should be EUR)
- User can choose a currency to convert to(Default should be DKK)
- Whenever amount, currency from or currency to changes we show what the amount translates to in the to currency
